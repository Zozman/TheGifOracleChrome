#The GIF Oracle For Chrome

The GIF Orcale Chrome Extension is an easy to use and fun way to get random animated GIFs using the Giphy API.

##Features

###Highlighted Word Search

The GIF Oracle allows you to highlight any word and search for a random GIF associated with it.  Just highlight the word, right click to bring up your context menu, and The GIF Oracle will search for it.

Once a result has been found, it will appear as a Google Notification.

The user then has the choice of opening the GIF in a new tab or copying the URL of the GIF to the clipboard for easy pasting anywhere on the Internet.  These functions can also be used directly from the context menu.  All results are also stored in Chrome's Notification Center for easy access to previous searches.

###Omnibox Search

If a user wishes to search for a random GIF based off a particular term, they can do so with the Omnibox.  By typing `oracle` into the Omnibox, the search box will then take the input and search for a random GIF.

The result will then be displayed in a notification as normal.
